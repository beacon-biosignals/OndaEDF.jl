Then OndaEDF.onda_samples_from_edf_signals is used to combine the EDF signals data into a single Onda.Samples per group.\n\nThe label of the original EDF.Signals are preserved in the :edf_channels field of the resulting SamplesInfos for each Samples generated.\n\nAny errors that occur are shown as Strings (with backtrace) and inserted into the :error column for the corresponding rows from the plan.\n\nSamples are returned in the order of :onda_signal_index.

This is a convenience function that first formulates an import plan via plan_edf_to_onda_samples, and then immediately executes this plan with edf_to_onda_samples.\n\nThe samples and executed plan are returned; it is strongly advised that you review the plan for un-extracted signals (where :kind or :channel is missing) and errors (non-nothing values in :error).\n\nCollections of EDF.Signals are mapped as channels to Onda.Samples via plan_edf_to_onda_samples.  The caller of this function can control the plan via the labels and units keyword arguments, all of which are forwarded to plan_edf_to_onda_samples.\n\nEDF.Signal labels that are converted into Onda channel names undergo the following transformations:\n\nthe label is whitespace-stripped, parens-stripped, and lowercased\ntrailing generic EDF references (e.g. \"ref\", \"ref2\", etc.) are dropped\nany instance of + is replaced with _plus_ and / with _over_\nall component names are converted to their \"canonical names\" when possible (e.g. \"m1\" in an EEG-matched channel name will be converted to \"a1\").\n\nSee the OndaEDF README for additional details regarding EDF formatting expectations.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#OndaEDF.plan_edf_to_onda_samples","page":"API Documentation","title":"OndaEDF.plan_edf_to_onda_samples","text":"plan_edf_to_onda_samples(header, seconds_per_record; labels=STANDARD_LABELS,\n                         units=STANDARD_UNITS)\nplan_edf_to_onda_samples(signal::EDF.Signal, args...; kwargs...)\n\nFormulate a plan for converting an EDF signal into Onda format.  This returns a Tables.jl row with all the columns from the signal header, plus additional columns for the Onda.SamplesInfo for this signal, and the seconds_per_record that is passed in here.\n\nIf no labels match, then the channel and kind columns are missing; the behavior of other SamplesInfo columns is undefined; they are currently set to missing but that may change in future versions.\n\nAny errors that are thrown in the process will be wrapped as SampleInfoErrors and then printed with backtrace to a String in the error column.\n\nMatching EDF label to Onda labels\n\nThe labels keyword argument determines how Onda channel and signal kind are extracted from the EDF label.\n\nLabels are specified as an iterable of signal_names => channel_names pairs. signal_names should be an iterable of signal names, the first of which is the canonical name used as the Onda kind.  Each element of channel_names gives the specification for one channel, which can either be a string, or a canonical_name => alternates pair.  Occurences of alternates will be replaces with canonical_name in the generated channel label.\n\nMatching is determined solely by the channel names.  When matching, the signal names are only used to remove signal names occuring as prefixes (e.g., \"[ECG] AVL\") before matching channel names.  See match_edf_label for details, and see OndaEDF.STANDARD_LABELS for the default labels.\n\nAs an example, here is (a subset of) the default labels for ECG signals:\n\n[\"ecg\", \"ekg\"] => [\"i\" => [\"1\"], \"ii\" => [\"2\"], \"iii\" => [\"3\"],\n                   \"avl\"=> [\"ecgl\", \"ekgl\", \"ecg\", \"ekg\", \"l\"], \n                   \"avr\"=> [\"ekgr\", \"ecgr\", \"r\"], ...]\n\nMatching is done in the order that labels iterates pairs, and will stop at the first match, with no warning if signals are ambiguous (although this may change in a future version)\n\n\n\n\n\nplan_edf_to_onda_samples(edf::EDF.File;\n                         labels=STANDARD_LABELS,\n                         units=STANDARD_UNITS,\n                         onda_signal_groupby=(:kind, :sample_unit, :sample_rate))\n\nFormulate a plan for converting an EDF.File to Onda Samples.  This applies plan_edf_to_onda_samples to each individual signal contained in the file, storing edf_signal_index as an additional column.  \n\nThe resulting rows are then passed to plan_edf_to_onda_samples_groups and grouped according to onda_signal_groupby (by default, the :kind, :sample_unit, and :sample_rate columns), and the group index is added as an additional column in onda_signal_index.\n\nThe resulting plan is returned as a table.  No signal data is actually read from the EDF file; to execute this plan and generate Onda.Samples, use edf_to_onda_samples.  The index of the EDF signal (after filtering out signals that are not EDF.Signals, e.g. annotation channels) for each row is stored in the :edf_signal_index column, and the rows are sorted in order of :onda_signal_index, and then by :edf_signal_index.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#OndaEDF.plan_edf_to_onda_samples_groups","page":"API Documentation","title":"OndaEDF.plan_edf_to_onda_samples_groups","text":"plan_edf_to_onda_samples_groups(plan_rows; onda_signal_groupby=(:kind, :sample_unit, :sample_rate))\n\nGroup together plan_rows based on the values of the onda_signal_groupby columns, creating the :onda_signal_index column and promoting the Onda encodings for each group using promote_encodings.\n\nIf the :edf_signal_index column is not present or otherwise missing, it will be filled in based on the order of the input rows.\n\nThe updated rows are returned, sorted first by the columns named in onda_signal_groupby and second by order of occurrence within the input rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#OndaEDF.edf_to_onda_annotations","page":"API Documentation","title":"OndaEDF.edf_to_onda_annotations","text":"edf_to_onda_annotations(edf::EDF.File, uuid::UUID)\n\nExtract EDF+ annotations from an EDF.File for recording with ID uuid and return them as a vector of Onda.Annotations.
